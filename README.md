# Ethernet_Tester_Pi-Pico
Ethernet tester with raspberry pi pico.
tester.py & tester_analog.py are NOT WORKING.

 
Code is INCREDIBLY inefficient, because I'm python beginner.

Using Pi Pico, Custom ethernet shield and LCD 16x2 display with I2C pins.
LCD Libraries:  https://github.com/T-622/RPI-PICO-I2C-LCD

IF you want to run this script automatically after power-on, rename tester_digital.py to main.py and save all 3 files on pi pico. (Open All files in thony, save - Raspberry Pi Pico, and here name it EXACTY as it is. Even with the .py suffix)





DUE TO PURE LAZINESS OF MY COLLEAGUE THERE WILL BE 2 VERSIONS. I now have to work on digital version, so the analog one will be less updated. HATE HIM. YOU know who you are. Lazy bastard.
