# Ethernet_Tester_Pi-Pico
Ethernet tester with raspberry pi pico.

IMPORTANT UPDATE!! DUE TO PURE LAZINESS OF MY COLLEAGUE THERE WILL BE 2 VERSIONS. I now have to work on digital version, so the analog one will be less updated. HATE HIM. YOU know who you are. Lazy bastard.
 
Code is INCREDIBLY inefficient, because I'm python beginner.

Using Pi Pico, Custom ethernet shield and LCD 16x2 display with I2C pins.
LCD Libraries:  https://github.com/T-622/RPI-PICO-I2C-LCD

IF you want to run this script automatically after power-on, rename tester.py to main.py and save all 3 files on pi pico. (Open All files in thony, save - Raspberry Pi Pico, and here name it EXACTY as it is. Even with the .py suffix)
